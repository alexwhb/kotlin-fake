# kotlin-fake
A data faker library that works with Kotlin Multiplatform. 

This library was inspired by a lot of the good faking libraries out there already, 
and I did not really create anything too new or revolutinary, but I wanted to have this tool 
for one of my work projects and I could not find one that attempted to port things to a multiplatform project
so I figured why not. 

This project builds off of a lot of really great code that is out there. A word of warning to anyone using this
I have not yet written any of the implementation for loading files on native. If you'd like to contribute please send me 
a PR... I'd be happy to merge it in if it looks goods.
